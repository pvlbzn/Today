# Frontend
This is a new topic, so there will be a series on *frontend* development. While doing your own project frontend , unfortunately, is unavoidable. The main target of this series is to learn how to develop frontend using software engineering practices and a sanity.

## Todo List
Here is an approximate progression path plan for a fontend, it includes topics in which, for now, I mostly concerned:

- How to write modular JS code
- How to use npm libs in frontend
- How to serve many JS modules to the client at once (thus avoiding latency costs)
- Assets serving
- Testing frontend code

- Whats up with CSS, HTML5

- Task runners such as Gulp
- Buzzwords: react, flux, redux, components, webpack
