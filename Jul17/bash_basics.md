## Bourne Again Shell
Bash is the GNU project shell. It is 'better' version of `sh`. It is available on all modern UNIX-like systems. It is a superset of the Bourne shell. `bash` can substitute `sh`, but if `bash` ran as `sh` it behaves differently. There are lots of shells: `csh`. `zsh`, `ksh`, `dash`, `bash`, etc.

`bash` can be tought like OS interface is some way. A funny thing that terminal *emulator* is already running a `bash` or whatever else.
