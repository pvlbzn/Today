# Design Pattern

> Each pattern describes a problem wich occures over and over again, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem is such a way that programer can reuse this solution a million times over, without ever doing the same way twice.

*Christopher Alexander*

Pattern has four essential elements:

- Pattern Name
- Problem
- Solution
- Consequences

#### Pattern Name
Used to describe problem+solution in a word or two.

#### Problem
Problem describes *when* to apply the pattern. It explains the problem and its context. E.g. how to represent alogirthms as objects.

#### Solution
Solution describes the elements that make up the design, their relations/responsibilities/collaborations. Pattern is like a remplate that can be applied in many different situations. Pattern provedes an abstract description of a design problem and how in solves it, in general.

#### Consequences
Consequences are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern. They are crucial in understanding the costs and benefits of applying the pattern like space/time trade-offs.

## Other Factors
Point of view affects one's interpretation of what is and is not a pattern. Also there is implementational difficulties. On one language a pattern can be implimented in a nature way and on another language application of the pattern can be difficult and arguable.
