###Single UNIX Specification

SUS it the collective name of a family of standatds for computer OS, compliance with which is required to qualify for usign the "UNIX" tm. Not every BSD or Linux based OS are submitted for compliance with the SUS, however developers generally aim for comliance with POSIX.

####POSIX

The *Portable Operating System Interface* specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. *POSIX* defines the API, along with command line shells and utility interfaces.

Actually, minority of operating systems have been certified to conform to one or more POSIX standatds(this means that thay passed the automated conformance tests). 

The reason from Linux side, Debian [doc](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-compat.en.html) states:

>Linux is intended to adhere to POSIX.1, but the POSIX standards cost real money and the POSIX.1 (and FIPS 151-2) certification is quite expensive; this made it more difficult for the Linux developers to work on complete POSIX conformance. The certification costs make it unlikely that Debian will get an official conformance certification even if it completely passed the validation suite. (The validation suite is now freely available, so it is expected that more people will work on POSIX.1 issues.)
