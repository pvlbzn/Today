###UNIX

History [scheme](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Unix_history-simple.svg).

Unix was designed to be portable, multitasking, multiuser in a time-sharing conf.

- use plain text for storing data
- hierarchical file system
- threating devices as files
- use of a large number of software tools (opposed to single monolith with all functionality)

Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike summarize this in *The Unix Programming Environment*.

The OS consists of many utilities aling with the master control profram, the kernel.

####Kernel

The kernel is a program which has a complete control over eevrything that occurs in the system, it is responsible for a memory management. Kernel is a core of OS.

**TODO**: Read [Linux Insides](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides).

- CPU
- Random-acess memory
- I/O
- Memory management
- Device management
- System calls

There are three types of Kernels, from design perspectie:

- Monolith
- Micro
- Hybrid

**READ**: 'Linux Insides' and 'The Unix Programming Environment' on this topic.

####Legal

AT&T sold its rights in Unix to Novel, which then sold its Unix business to SCO, but the UNIX (tm) passed to the industry standards consorium The Open Group which allows the use of the mark for certified (for a high fee) OS compliant with the Single Unix Specification.
