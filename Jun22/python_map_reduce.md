## Read The Code
This is a short text overview, all the code in `./f.py`

## map
`map()` maps a sequence to a function usign `map(func, seq)`.

## filter
Filter extracts each element in the sequence for which the function returns True.

## reduce
Reduce takes a iterator to process and returns a singe value. Reduce was moved into `functools`.

## Problem
Guido [doesn't like these functions](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196). Guido loves list comprehension.
