### Spark Framework

`Spark` - Sinatra inspired framework for Java, as states github page of the Spark. I choose Spark because it is a tiny framework what automatically makes it easier to understand how it works, why it works, what it does. Also, it will be interesting to compare Spark to Sinatra, because Sinatra was a first web thing I touched.

The purpose of this series on Spark:

- Understand how Java plays in web frameworks world
- Try Java flawored framework
- Make some study on frameworks in general

Last point is truly not least because I prefer, especially while learning, to not use frameworks for everything and I'm not a fan of frameworks approach in big picture. Instead of learning how web (and things) works people are learning web frameworks. Okey. So this will be a first spin into Java frameworks and will be a first attempt to understand the framework. Before begin, I checked a source code, it looks legit.
