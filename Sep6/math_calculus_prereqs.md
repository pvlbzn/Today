# Calculus
In order to understand and have some success with Calculus a good algebra and trigonometry skills are required. Calculus algebra and trigonometry with *limits*. There are some skills which are more 'usefull' than another.


## Algebra Skills

- Factoring
- Completing the Square
- Basic Functions and Transformations
- Simplifying Expressions
- Formula Manupulation

#### Factoring
Many of the problems in calculus will involve *finding the roots of a function* and for the most part that means *factoring* (not only ***polynomial factoring*** but also factoring with ***rational exponents***).

#### Completing the Square
Basically it is when quadratic equation

#### Basic Functions and Transformations
Algebra can be simplified by understanding that there are *basic functions* and that many of the other functions are transformations of those *basic building blocks*.

#### Simplifying Expressions
Knowing how to combine similar or like terms and properties of exponents like adding exponents when multiplying factors that have the same base or multiplying exponents when raising to a power is necessary.

#### Formula Manipulations
Formula manipylation is much more that just memorizing formulas and plugging the values into them. The basic geometry formulas for area and volume of common figures must be known.
