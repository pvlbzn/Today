###Today I learned.

####What
One year long project. Every day I will make a note of the computer science, programming things which I learned today. 


####How
Generally, documents will be about a particular topic, which usually will be represented in its name, however, it isn't possible for every case, since the  main purpose is to learn and reflect, not to create trustworthy source of an information.


####Why

To:

- Keep track of my research and study
- Never research one thing twice
- Never lose a material
- In case of forgotten topic: refresh it ASAP

Generally Im a "self-taught" programmer who learning a theory, multiple programming languages, technologies at once and it isn't rare thing when I just forget how to implement something, or a some things in details.

UPD: 36th day of the my implementation of the TIL
This project is much more rewarding and meaningful then I though before.
