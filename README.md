## Today I Learned.


### What
One year long, a self challenging and a motivating project. Every day I will learn a concept or a technology which is related to Applied Computer Science, Software Engineering or just a plain Computer Science.

This is an updated version of the `README.md` file. Since the beggining of the project the main concept was slightly changed. Initially each day I was planning to record stuff which I learned at this day. However, as a time shows, it is not possible to be productive if you are trying to record and learn at once, especially if there are 10-15-30 things in a day.

Today concept sounds more like: "*Today I learned for 'Today I Learned'*." Weird, but **it works**. At least last 100 days this was a case.


### Structure
Every day owns its directory, which is named is `[Month][Day]` fashion. Each document has a [[field]_[description]] naming convention.
