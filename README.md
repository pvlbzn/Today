## Today I Learned.

### What
One year long, a self challenging and a motivating project. Every day I will learn a concept or a technology which is related to Applied Computer Science, Software Engineering or just a plain Computer Science.

This is an updated version of the `README.md` file. Since the beggining of the project the main concept was slightly changed. Initially each day I was planning to record stuff which I learned at this day. However, as a time shows, it is not possible to be productive if you are trying to record and learn at once, especially if there are 10-15-30 things in a day.

Today concept sounds more like: "*Today I learned for 'Today I Learned'*." Weird, but **it works**. At least last 100 days this was a case.

### Current Status: September 12
Due to extreme busyness the quality of the last week TIL had significantly dropped. TILs were done in a last 20-40 minutes of the each day and I actually learned almost nothing from them.

I **have to** suspend this project for a month. This decision is very hard since there were already done 169 days of constant learning without excuses, even then I was migrating in another country, etc. This is done for a good.

Project will be resumed and prolonged for a suspention time + one week.

### Structure
Every day owns its directory, which is named is `[Month][Day]` fashion. Each document has a [[field]_[description]] naming convention.

Repository exists for historical reason.

#### Short History
Project survived for 169 days in a row. Last run of `count.bash` tells that there are 322 .md files, notes.

#### Lesson Learned
Better name for this kind of a project is "Today I ${x}" where x = "tried" or "got familiar", x != "learned".
