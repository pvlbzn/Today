###Scikit-learn, Tensorflow.

[**TensorFlow**](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) is a low-level library that allows you to build machine learning models using a set of simple operators, like: add, matmul, concat.

[**Scikit-learn**](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) is a higher-level library that includes implementations of several machine learning algorithms.

Thus, it is possible to implement scikit-learn on top of TensorFlow. Here is a [repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/skflow).

TensorFlow is implemented in C++ with Python bindings, and Scikit-learn is a Python implementation with all pluses and minuses of both approaches.
