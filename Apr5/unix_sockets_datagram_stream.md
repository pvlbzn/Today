### Socket

Python provides a slightly object-based interface to low-level operating system calls that are normally used to accomplish networking on POSIX-compliant OS.

From [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html?highlight=socket#socket):

> The Python interface is a straightforward transliteration of the Unix system call and library interface for sockets to Pythonâ€™s object-oriented style: the [`socket()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html?highlight=socket#socket.socket) function returns a *socket object* whose methods implement the various socket system calls. Parameter types are somewhat higher-level than in the C interface: as with `read()` and `write()` operations on Python files, buffer allocation on receive operations is automatic, and buffer length is implicit on send operations.



####Language-agnostic

There are several types of Internet sockets:

- Datagram sockets (SOCK_DGRAM)


- Stream sockets (SOCK_STREAM)


- Raw sockets

**Datagram sockets** are sometimes called 'connectionless sockets'. **Stream sockets** are reliable two-way connected communication streams. Stream sockets is ordered so 1, 2 will arrive as 1, 2.

#### SOCK_STREAM

`telnet` as an example of stream sockets. Web browsers use a HTTP protocol which uses stream sockets to get pages.

Stream sockets uses a protocol "**The Thransmission Control Protocol**", **TCP** (RFC 791) for short. TCP makes sure your data arrives sequentially and error-free. TCP/IP, where IP is an "Internet Protocol", which deals with Internet routing and is not generally resposible for data integrity.



####SOCK_DGRAM

If you send a datagram, it may arrive. It may arrive out of order. If it arrives, the data within the packet will be error-free. Datagram sockets also use IP for routing, they use the "**User Datagram Protocol**", **UDP** (RFC 768). UDP is 'connectionless' because there is no need to keep connection open. You just build a packet, slap an IP header on it with destination info, and send it out. No open connection.

But why to use UDP, if it is so unreliable? **Speed**.



####Diff example

If you are sending chat messages, TCP is great. If you are sending 40 positional updates per second if the players in the world, maybe it doesn't matter so much if one or two get dropped, UDP is ok choice.
