####Android and Java

Android system doesn't include JVM. Android uses Android Runtime (ART) which replaces Dalvik process virtual machine. ART and Dalvik are compatible runtimes running Dex bytecode, thus Dalvik apps should run fine on ART. On Dalvik programs was written on Java and compiled to bytecode for the JVM, which them translated to Dalvik bytecode and stored in .dex, Dalvik EXecutable.
